When I visited Copenhagen I discover an **happy country** where people live in a soberly and merry way.   
**It takes more than one weekend to really know a new country but, at the same time but  it is possible to appreciate the culture and the spirit of a country in just three days.**  
So I have put together what I think would be the perfect three days in the city, suitable come summer or winter.
  
  
### Day 1

Copenhagen is a such an easy city to get around and you can make the most of this by walking or hiring bikes to get around while there.
The **free walking tours** are the best way to get closer to a new city and starting to meet his values and traditions.
Esben, our nice guide, gave us the basis to understand the Danish and their lifestyle: nature, welfare, food and happiness.
  
  
>_In Copenhagen architecture and nature merge each other in a beautiful way. I was particularly impressed by the importance that water holds in the urban environment: water is everywhere in Copenhagen and the Government spent millions of euros to reclaim canals around the city._

The old **port of Nyhavn** has been recently upgraded in order to make citizens closer to the water. This is why the famous buildings were painted with bright colors: thanks to this the port moved from a dangerous site to a glamour place.
  
To make the most out of my first day in Denmark, I took a quick look at the **University District**. In this area near the University of Copenhagen you may feel the “hygge”, a Danish word whose meaning is “to be warm, cozy and relaxed”.

Reading **recommendation**: if you you want to learn more about **hygge** and its meaning, there is a very interesting book about it edited by the Happiness Research Institute of Copenhagen.

 I could definitely experience hygge at [**Pauladan Bog & Café**](https://www.paludan-cafe.dk/ ). Enjoy a coffee and a cake in this warm candlelit ambiance just opposite the Univiersity Library. The Cafè’s rooms are filled of books from the floor to the ceiling, all available to customers.

I chose an Airbnb accommodation since I read that Copenhagen is a very expansive city. Plus, the idea was to spend the day around the city so a less and cheaper lodging was the best.
  
### Day 2
  
Good morning Copenhagen!
I first head down to the the **Little Mermaid**: the fictional character created by Andersen, is the most popular attraction among tourists. She is represented by a bronze statue which stares at the sea from a rock at the Langelinie promenade.

>_The beauty of that corner is in the atmosphere around the Mermaid, especially thanks the sound of waves that crumble on the rocks._
  
In Denmark lunch time means Street Food!
**The Papiroen Copenhagen Street Food** is filled of dozens of stands, each offering delicious specialities. It is the a great place to chill, eat, drink and watch the boats passing the canal. But you cannot leave Denmark without tasting the **smørrebrød**: an open sandwich stuffed with meat or fish, cheese and cold cuts: my favourite one is filled with caviar and salmon. This particular “butter bread” usually has decorations to make it more appealing.

From the Street Food you can head up to **Christiana** was the last stop of my second day in Copenhagen.
I concentrated a whole afternoon in the hippie village to learn the more I could about it. Christiana is a free-town, still part of the Danish capital, that does not see itself as part of the EU.
  
![Christiania](../assets/images/christiania3.jpg )
Along its main road, **Pusher Street**, many people smoke and sell weed, even if in a somewhat disguised way; pictures must not be taken anywhere inside this street.
>However **_Christiania is not only Pusher Street: be sure to also discover the wider area of the Christianshavn, home to creativity, arts scene and alternative way of life._**

### DAY 3
  
  
The first stop on my last day in the Danish capital was the **Tårnet**, Parliament Tower, space which was abandoned despite its impressive architectural structure. Standing 106 meters high, it is the tallest tower in Copenhagen and allows for fantastic views across the city. Upper chambers were used as storage until 2014 when the tower was opened up to the public. Tip for girls: tie your hair before going up!
  
![View from the Christian Tower](../assets/images/tarnet-view.jpg )
  
Later take a stroll into the **Royal Library Garden**, connected to the great philosopher Søren Kierkegaard whose statue stands in front a small pond. This was the most peaceful and reflective space of Copenhagen before turning into a Pokémon Go station…
  
![Kierkegaard statue](../assets/images/library-garden.jpg )
  
After taking a tram and took away the luggage at my accommodation, it was time to explore the **Kastellet**. It is a well-preserved military fortress encircling the old Copenhagen.  The construction was inaugurated in 1626, serving as the stronghold. The Citadel now houses the Danish Defense Intelligence Service. This is a very popular park with a moat and windmill, and it is often used by locals for picnics and annual events.
  
  
![Kastellet](../assets/images/kastellet1.jpg )
  
By walk the **Amalienborg** for the changing of the guard, locals told me that the Royal family members live in that place and you can meet them every day. Monarchy in Denmark is only an eminent family who pays taxes and loves his country: in this way the Danish royal family evolved and survived.
  
![Amalienborg Slotplads](../assets/images/copy-amalienborg.jpg )
  
**Remember**: if you have some dead time in your travel schedule, take a look at the **Design Museum**.
I was not particularly excited by my tour: the museum does not involve visitors with too many pieces of stuff with no explanations and too long historical introductions.
On the other hand, the chairs' department is interesting and curious. The celebrated **shell chair**, that we all have set once at least or we would like to have at home, was designed by the Danish designer Hans Wegner. Here you can understand the iter that has led to this futuristic design and, in general, the chair design's evolution to nowadays.
  
![The Design Museum](../assets/images/deign-museum.jpg )
  
The Danish, with their **Welfare State**, is a great example of civilization. The community wellness is a  priority compared to the individuals one: this is the way in which they look at the future also thanks to the respect for the environment.
  
  
>_I will always bring with me the vibes I felt landing at the Kastrup: a friendly but silent atmosphere broken only by gentle whispers. Danes are not people which love to win by tricking, pacifism and artistic sense have always characterized them._

**Tips** for a souvenir? Denmark is the home of LEGO, from zero to 99 years a creative gift that everyone enjoys.
